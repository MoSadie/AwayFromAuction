# Away from Auction

## What is this mod?

This mod allows you to view the Hypixel SkyBlock auction house outside of the Hypixel server.

## How do I use this mod?
0) Download and install this mod like any other Minecraft Forge mod.
1) There are two methods for configuring your Hypixel API key:
    1) For people who don't already have an API key:
        1) Join the Hypixel Minecraft Server: `mc.hypixel.net`
        2) Type the command `/api`
        3) Write down the API key. (Just in case you need to manually input it.)
        4) Look for a chat message letting you know the key was automatically detected.
    2) For people who already have an API key:
        1) Run the command `/afa key <paste your key here>` while in any Minecraft world/server.
2) From any other server use the `/afa` command to view the auction house!
